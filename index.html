GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
Chris Aurelio, UMass Lowell Computer Science, christopher_aurelio@student.uml.edu

Description: This is a simple personal website created using HTML and CSS. I used it to highlight some photos I've taken in the past, along with linking my photography portfolio. At the bottom, I added a table to showcase some programming languages that I know.

    <h1>Chris Aurelio: My First Website</h1> <!-- Largest heading. Acting as the title of the website -->
    <p> <!-- Paragraph acting as a description for the website. It's pretty basic, but I couldn't think of much else to add here that would be fitting. -->
      Hey there! I'm Chris Aurelio. This is my first website created using HTML and CSS.<br>
      However, it is not my only website in general. You can find a link to my photography portfolio created with a website builder below.<br>
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.chrisaurelio.com">Photography Portfolio</a> <!-- Link to my photography portfolio. -->
    <br><br><br> <!-- These are break tags to add spacing between the elements. I eventually realized that I could use padding in CSS styles which was a better method, but I left these tags here to show my initial thought process. -->
    <h2>Some Photos I Have Taken</h2> <!-- Some images that I have taken. They are linked to a website because I figured it might be more reliable than having the photos stored locally when I add the website to GitHub. -->
